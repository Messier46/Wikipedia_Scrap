It was bestowed for his actions at Lone Pine in August 1915, during the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War. Born in Wellington, Shout had served in the Second Boer War, where he was mentioned in despatches. He immigrated to Sydney in 1907 and was active in the part-time Citizens Forces. In August 1914, he joined the Australian Imperial Force and was appointed a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion. He took part in the Anzac landings at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. For his leadership during the invasion, Shout was awarded the Military Cross and later mentioned in despatches. Shout's three gallantry awards at Gallipoli made him the most highly decorated member of the Australian force in the campaign.
